[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/spences10/vscode-vba-icons.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

VBA Icons for VSCode.

You'll need to change back to your previous icon pack once finished with VBA icons as there no support for other file types.

These icons support .bas, .frm, .cls, .sht and .wkb the last two are what I export the Worksheet and Workbook code into.

## Installation
Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.
```
ext install vscode-vba-icons
```
